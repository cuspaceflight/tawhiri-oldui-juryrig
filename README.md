# CUSF Predictor - "Version 3.0; tawhiri juryrig"

Cambridge University Spaceflight landing predictor - a web-based tool for predicting the flight path and landing location of latex meteorological sounding balloons.

This is a "temporary" repository, a stepping stone on the way to completion of larger CUSpaceflight work to rewriting the predictor.
We're replacing bits one at a time, and since the tawhiri wind downloader is completed, this project glues the old web UI to it.
